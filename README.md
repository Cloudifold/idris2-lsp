# [WIP] idris2-lsp
Language Server for Idris2-0.4.0.

Refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/idris-community/idris2-lsp/wiki) for editor-specific configurations.

**NOTE: At this stage the LSP server requires an ipkg file to work correctly, for reference material about packages look [here](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/packages.html) and [here](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/packages.html). To start a new project with an ipkg, even for a single file, you can issue the idris2 --init command, which provides an interactive interface for package creation.**

## Compile
To compile `idris2-lsp` you need `Idris2-0.4.0` (available [here](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/releases/tag/v0.4.0)) and you also need the `idris2api` package. See the [install guide](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to build the `idris2api` package.

## Install
Run `make install` to install the server, by default it will be placed in the same default directory of the Idris2 compiler, i.e. `~/.idris2/bin`.

## Go to commands and package dependencies
The server provides support for some go to commands, e.g. go to definition, however to reach modules declared in other packages you must install packages with `idris2 --install-with-src` instead of `idris2 --install`. To access the standard library run `make install-with-src-libs` after building the compiler and `make install-with-src-api` if you also want to access to the `idris2api` package.

## Configuration options
Server options that can be set via the `initializationOptions` object in the initialization message:

|Option key|Type|Description|
|----------|----|-----------|
|`logFile`|`string`|Absolute location of the log file for the server (default: stderr)|
|`longActionTimeout`|`number`|Timeout in ms for long actions, e.g. expression search (default: 5000)|
|`maxCodeActionResults`|`number`|Maximum number of multiple code actions for a single command, e.g. expression search (default: 5)|

## Examples

Some examples can be found in the `test/lsp/example` directory. Many of the existing functionality still needs to be documented.
